<h2>inception</h2>

<p>Yusuf drives the team around the first level as they are sedated into
  the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. Cobb persuades Robert that
  he has been kidnapped by Browning, and that Cobb is his subconscious protector,
   a new kick synchronized with the van hitting the water. Mal's projection
    emerges in Eames' level and kills Robert; Cobb kills Mal, and Saito succumbs
     to his wounds. Cobb and Ariadne enter limbo to rescue Robert and Saito,
      while Eames prepares a kick by rigging the hospital with explosives.
