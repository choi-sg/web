 hello web
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenet_(film)">green company</a> is very <strong>fucking</strong> <u>hell</u>. i don't know what to do. so i think i have to ask my dad what
he wants.
<p>Nolan took more than five years to write the screenplay after deliberating
about Tenet's central ideas for over a decade. Pre-production began in late 2018,
 casting in March 2019, and principal photography lasted three months in Denmark,
 Estonia, India, Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States, from May to November.</p>
 <p>Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot on 70 mm and IMAX. Scenes of time manipulation were filmed both backwards and forwards.
 Over one hundred vessels and thousands of extras were used.</p>
