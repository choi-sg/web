<h2>what is a movie</h2>
 <p>Schultz and Django hatch a plan. They know that if they offer to
   buy Broomhilda, Calvin will price her beyond reach, so they will instead
   offer $12,000 (equivalent to $355,000 in 2019) for one of his best fighters
   as a pretext to acquiring Broomhilda for a nominal sum. They can then feign
    second thoughts about buying the fighter and leave with just Broomhilda.
    They meet Calvin at his gentlemen's club and make the offer. Intrigued,
    Calvin invites them to the Candyland plantation..</p>
